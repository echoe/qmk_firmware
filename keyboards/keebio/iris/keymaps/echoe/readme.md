# Iris Advantage

A layout inspired by the Kinesis Advantage, syncing up the thumb clusters, but with an encoder.
Features:
-Single encoder with different states based on current active layer
-Extremely lazy raise/lower layers
-Advantage-like thumb clusters
-Made by someone whose name is also the keyboard's name, wow
